// These vars are populated by GoReleaser via -ldflags.
// They live here so the linker path matches: main.version etc.
//
// The initializers MUST be string CONSTANTS. `-X main.version=...` patches the
// variable's initial data, but a non-constant initializer (e.g. `= build.Version`)
// makes the compiler emit a package init that runs AFTER the linker's patch and
// overwrites it — which is why every binary built before 2026-08-31 reported
// "dev". The release workflow now asserts the stamped binary prints its tag.
